<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>

<bold-text>What is a barycentric coordinate? </bold-text> <br><br>
<p>
    Barycentric coordinates describe a point in a triangle with three weights,
     each representing how close the point is to one of the vertices. 
     The three weights sum up to 1, with a larger value indicating being closer to the vertex.
      If all three weights are positive, then the point lies within the triangle but 
      if one or more is negative then the point lies outside the triangle.

<p>
    To demonstrate this idea, the image depicts a single triangle with red, green, and blue vertices. 
    Using barycentric coordinates, the color at each pixel within the triangle is determined using
    a weighted combination of the three vertex colors. The resulting triangle is a color gradient
    with the colors smoothly blending into each other between the corners.

    The “color wheel” in test7.svg is the result of many small triangles arranged in a circular
     pattern with each triangle interpolating between three vertex colors.
