<h2>Task 5: “Pixel sampling” for texture mapping</h2>

<bold-text>Explain pixel sampling in your own words and describe how you implemented it to perform texture mapping. </bold-text> <br><br>
<p>
    Pixel sampling determines how texture colors are chosen when pixels are mapped in continuous UV coordinate space. 
     UV values are not integers, so they need to be converted to discrete texel colors. <br><br>

    The implementation involves computing barycentric coordinates for each sample point inside the triangle and using 
    them to interpolate the triangle’s texture coordinates. Depending on the sampling mode, these interpolated 
    coordinates will return either a nearest-neighbor or bilinear sampled color. 
</p>

<bold-text>Briefly discuss the two different pixel sampling methods, nearest and bilinear. </bold-text> <br><br>
<p>
    Nearest sampling chooses the closest texel whose center is closest to the UV coordinate. 
    While it is fast to perform, it can produce more jagged results. <br> <br>

    Bilinear sampling takes the four texels surrounding the UV coordinate and blends them
     based on the fractional position of UV within the cell. This method produces smoother 
     results but requires  more computation. 
</p>

<bold-text>Show and compare four png screenshots using nearest sampling at 1 sample per pixel, 
    nearest sampling at 16 samples per pixel, bilinear sampling at 1 sample per pixel, 
    and bilinear sampling at 16 samples per pixel.

<p>
    The warped UC Berkeley logo was used to demonstrate the difference between the two sampling
     methods since it contains a lot of small details and fine lines where the differences 
     can be more clearly observed when zoomed in.

<bold-text>Comment on the relative differences. Discuss when there will be a large difference between 
    the two methods and why.
</bold-text> <br><br>

<p>
    The nearest sampled images have more distinct pixels which creates sharp textures but appear jagged when zoomed in. 
    The bilinear sampled images have a more smoothed appearance since the colors are determined by 
    blending the four surrounding texels, resulting in a less pixelated look even when zoomed in. <br><br>

    The two methods will have the largest difference when the texture has a lot of fine details since 
    it involves more edges where the difference can be the most clearly observed. While higher 
    sampling rates do result in the edges being less jagged, the averaging of the bilinear sampling 
    still produces a smoother result at the same sampling level.
