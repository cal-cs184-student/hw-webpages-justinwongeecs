<p>
    The robot is modified to have both arms raised over its head into a celebratory pose. 
    Transformations were applied on the “upper arms”, rotating the blocks to translate the 
    blocks slightly outwards and rotating them upwards to simulate shoulder movement.
    Then, upward translations and upward rotations  were applied on the “lower arms” 
    to simulate bending at the elbows to put the arms up. 

    Since SVG transformations are hierarchical, the lower arms move in relation to how 
    the upper arms move, so it was necessary to make adjustments accordingly to make sure 
    the transformations achieve the desired visual effect.Transformations were performed 
    on one side first before mirroring them across the vertical axis in order to maintain symmetry.
